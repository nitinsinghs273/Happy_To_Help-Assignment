# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation

### Force Install All npm Modules

If you encounter dependency conflicts or other issues while installing npm modules, you can forcefully reinstall all npm modules by following these steps:

1. **Remove `node_modules` Directory and `package-lock.json` File**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   ```

## Forcefully Install npm Modules

## Install `npm install --force`

After removing the node_modules directory and package-lock.json file, run the following command to reinstall all npm modules with the --force flag:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
